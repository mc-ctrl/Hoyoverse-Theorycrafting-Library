Attribute Anomal System is a special part of ZZZ's combat System. Through formation of reasonable Team to trigger Attribute Anomal can effectively improve the combat efficiency.<br>
In this chapter, I will introduce how to trigger Attribute Anomal and calculate the Attribute Anomal DMG.<br>

# What is Attribute Anomal
*"Dealing elemental damage also accumulates Anomaly Buildup that inflicts various Attribute Anomalies on enemies!*<br>
*Electric attacks counter robotic enemies.*<br>
*Fire attacks counter organic enemies.*<br>
*Ether attacks counter Ether enemies."*<br>
The above text is ZZZ's official introduction to Attribute Anomal, it may be modified in subsequent tests.<br>
So how to accumalate Anomaly Bulidup?<br>
# Attribute Anomaly Accumalation
As you see, dealing elemental damage will accumulate Anomaly Bulidup. Certain Elemental DMG accumlate certain Attribute Anomaly Buildup.<br>
In ZZZ CBT2, most agent attacks will accumlate Attribute Anomaly Buildup, and some attack from Bangboo will also accumlate certain Attribute Anomaly(This is generally written down in the description of Bangboo's skill).<br>
Different skills accumlate different amount of Anomaly Bulidup. The EX Special Attack, Chain Attack, Ultimate and Assist Follow-up generally accumlates a great amount of Anomaly Buildup. For example, Grace's EX Special Attack accumlates 8.6 times as much Anomaly Bulidup as her Special Attack, but only deals 3.6 times DMG. So it's important to trigger more EX Special Attack, Chain Attack, Ultimate and Assist Follow-up.<br>
The amount of Anomaly Buildup is subject to change in tests, so the data is not displayed here.<br>
Note: If agent's Attribute is not Physical, she doesn't accumlate Physical Anomaly Buildup when dealing Physical DMG.<br>
There is property called Anomaly Rate Bonus in CBT2, this property is directly multiplicative with skill's amount of Anomaly Buildup.<br>
Attribute Anomaly RES only affects the Attribute Anomaly Accumalation, not Attribute Anomaly DMG. In subsequent tests, it will be fixed as Attribute Anomaly Buildup RES.<br>
# Assault
*"Dealing Physical Damage to enemies causes Physical Anomaly Buildup, which triggers the Assault effect when enough is accumulated.*<br>
*Assault: Interrupts the enemy and deals massive Physical Damage."*<br>
# Freeze
*"Dealing Ice Damage to enemies causes Ice Anomaly Buildup, which triggers the Freeze effect when enough is accumulated.*<br>
*Freeze: Immobilizes the enemy for a certain period, and triggers Shatter at the end of the effect, dealing Ice damage."*<br>
# Burn
*"Dealing Fire damage to enemies accumulates the Fire Attribute Anomaly, which triggers the Burn effect when enough is accumulated.*<br>
*Burn: Deals continuous Fire damage. Organic enemies are unable to move while Burned."*<br>
# Corruption
*"Dealing Ether damage to enemies accumulates the Ether Attribute Anomaly, causing the Corruption effect when enough is accumulated.*<br>
*Corruption: Causes additional Ether damage when attacked. Corrupted Ethereal enemies will also attack both friend and foe."*<br>
# Shock
*"Dealing Electric damage to enemies accumulates the Electric Attribute Anomaly, which triggers the Shock effect when enough is accumulated.*<br>
*Shock: Being attacked intermittently triggers additional Electric damage and interrupts enemy actions. Robotic enemies are unable to move while Shocked."*<br>
